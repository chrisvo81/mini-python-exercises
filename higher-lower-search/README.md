# Higher Lower Search

> Inspired by : http://www.higherlowergame.com/

The classic version of higher lower is the game where you guess and compare one search term versus the other search term.

For example:

**"The Grand Budapest hotel"**, which is a movie, against another search term **"AFL"**, which is the American Football League.

As a player, you have to guess if the second one has higher or lower searches than the first one.
This game will continue on as long as you keep getting your guess correct.

As soon as your guess is wrong, the game will end. The score will be show to you when the game is end.
